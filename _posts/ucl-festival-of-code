The Festival of Code (14 - 19 June 2021) celebrated the contribution software and coding communities make to research and innovation. Participants learnt new skills, tools and insights, as well as developed their network across UCL. Attendees were from all faculties, MSc and PhD research students, researchers and members of professional services.  The festival's themes were: Celebrating Communities | Exploring Open Science | Creating Impact | R Project Showcase | Collaborative Hackday We would like to thank our colleagues from who have organised these events.

## Monday 14th June: Celebrating Communities
### Funder panel: Challenges & opportunties of funding research software
Software is used across research cycle. Join this panel discussion to learn about funding opportunities which support research software and funders' perspectives regarding the challenges of funding research software. Slides:
EPSRC: [Challenges & opportunities of funding research software](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/research/sites/research/files/challenges_opportunities_of_funding_research_software.pdf) 
Sage Publishing: [Supporting tools for Social Sciences](https://github.com/sagepublishing/sage_tools_social_science/blob/master/docs/ucl_codefest_2021.pdf) 
Wellcome Trust: [Challenges and opportunities for funding computational research](https://zenodo.org/record/4943834#.YzNPC6TMI2x)

### Coding culture: the cultural values of five coding communities
This reflective panel discussion will explore the histories, the cultural differences, and the shared values of five coding communities - Python, R, Julia, Ruby, & Fortran. Join us to hear from experienced programmers on how they see the programming community they belong to. Organised by Gui Heurich (UCL Anthropology) and he is working at the intersection coding and anthropology. 

### Past, Present & Future of Research Software Engineering @UCL
UCL was the first university, in 2012, to create a professional dedicated research software development group. Since then, the UCL Research Software Development Group has grown and expanded its services it provides to UCL's researchers. Join us to hear the story [you tube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkJC1q4VioxiezOu7-cr3434r-6Z7BE5c) behind some of the researchers that have been supported by this group,  find out about the specialised services we offer to improve your research, and learn more about UCL's new Centre for Advanced Research Computing from our new director James Hetherington. Organised by the Research Software Development Group (UCL Advanced Research Computing).
