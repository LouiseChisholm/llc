I led a monthly forum between 2/20 and 5/21 that brought together people who work at the interface between the researchers and the eResearch Infrastructure ecosystem.  Attendees were from different services from across UCL, this included Research IT Services, ISD, Departmental resesarch IT teams, UCL Library services, OVPR, Legal Services, and Research Services.
The Forum developed connections and best practice between individuals at UCL undertaking similar activities, it provided the opportunity to share new initiatives, priorities and challenges such as COVID Lockdowns.
