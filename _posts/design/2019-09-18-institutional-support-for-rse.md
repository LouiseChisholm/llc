[Science and Engineering South](https://www.ses.ac.uk/) (SES) is a consortium of six major universities based in the South East that have an excellent history of supporting the RSE community. The RSE campaign was led from the University of Southampton, UCL developed the model for the RSE Group which has spread across the country, and all the participating universities support RSE activities.The panellists are:
* Alys Brett, Chair of the Society of Research Software Engineering.
* Clare Gryce, Deputy Director, ITS Operations and Research, University of Sussex. 
* Professor David Price, UCL Vice-Provost. 
* Susan Littleson, Deputy Director HR, Imperial College London.
* John Robinson
* Jonathan Cooper, UCL Research Software Development Group,
With the addition of two heads of RSE groups. Over the last six months there has been a drive by the SES universities to recognise the RSE career path. The panel will discuss why SES universities are choosing to increase support for RSEs, the problems that have held back recognition for RSEs and the SES institutionsâ€™ approach to solving them. The goal of the panel is to support the growth of RSE careers across UK academia by sharing the experiences of the SES institutions in supporting RSEs.
