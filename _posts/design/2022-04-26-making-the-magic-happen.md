Research projects often require technical specialists with expertise in data, software, and computing facilities to deliver, support and accelerate quality research. These specialists help to make the magic happen in research. This online event will enable you to explore the opportunities and career pathways in research data, research software, and research computing. In the morning session we will hear from leading researchers about how their research benefits from the input of RTPs and also from practitioners themselves about how they contribute to enhancing research outputs. In the afternoon session we will hear from leaders about the opportunities in their team and there will be informal networking sessions.

* Find out what these different roles involve and how they are essential for effective research
* Learn about the experiences and career pathways of colleagues
* Discover the focus of different teams/groups and network with potentially future colleagues!

Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith from the University of Cambridge will chair the event and confirmed speakers include:
* Professor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London
* Amy Strange, the Francis Crick Institute
* Professor Nicola Shelton, University College London
* Tom King, QMUL
* Dr Michael Ball, UKRI-BBSRC

This event is organised by Science and Engineering South, in collaboration with RSLondon and UCL eResearch Domain.
