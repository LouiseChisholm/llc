Gain hands-on experience and explore your career options in high performance computing (HPC), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cloud technologies at our undergraduate and graduate student 'Cluster Challenge' and Career Showcase held on 17-18 February 2022. HPC clusters can perform the most demanding simulations and data-intensive analyses and are used in a wide range of academic disciplines and industry sectors e.g. modelling climate change, developing energy efficient catalysts, or understanding pharmaceutical drug-target interactions.  

 Take part to develop your technical skills by completing different challenges using UCL's powerful HPC clusters and software packages - there's a prize! You can participate as a team or as an individual. You or your teammates will need some computing skills. Take this opportunity to find out about careers in HPC  from technical and non-technical experts, and network with potential employers. 

Kickstart your HPC Journey is a work package in the DiRAC Federation Pr and is being led by Advanced Research Computing at University College London using UKRI Digital Research Infrastructure funding awarded to the STFC DiRAC HPC Facility
