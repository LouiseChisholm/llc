Software entrepreneurship skills enable students, researchers and academics to increase the impact of their research software by increasing its accessibility, usability and sustainability. 79 researchers, representing 10 faculties, looking to be informed and inspired.

Before the event, the attendees revealed that they are currently (or will be) developing software and wanted to know about commercialization process and how increase the impact of their research.  On the 23rd November 2016 participants heard from experts who provide support from across UCL and researchers who shared their experiences and insights from commercialising their software.

    * Prof Jonathan Tennyson (Physics and Astronomy), founded Quantemol in 2004 and is its CSO. He shared how generating income can support ongoing software maintenance and future developments, which ensures that the longevity of the software and subsequently its impact.  He also highlighted how establishing Quantemol was included in REF2014 as a case study and assisted his case for promotion to professor. 

* Dr Daniel Hulme founded and is the CEO of Satalia in 2008 and is its CEO and is member of the UCL Computer Science IMPACT team. He highlighted that although research software might have many potential applications, it is necessary to identify those who value it sufficiently to pay to use it. He also mentioned the importance of networking and understanding your customers. 

* Dr Jun Wang (Computer Science) co-founded MediaGamma in 2014 and is its CTO. He shared how commitment is key in developing a spinout company and the support available from UCLB.  MediaGamma was the first recipient of Proof of Concept funding from the UCL Technology Fund in 2015 and received the UCLB One-to- Watch award for 2016.
